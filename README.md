# Covid Response Policy among Countries with Different Happiness Levels

You can find full analysis on the [**project website**](https://vladimircao.github.io/final_project/). This project evaluates how different degree of covid government responses may affect local happiness levels. We use data from [Oxford COVID-19 Government 
Response Tracker (OXCGRT)](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19-government-response-tracker) and [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) to employ unsupervised predict model and unsupervised cluster analysis, to evaluate the between group differences in clusters and their possible reasons. Readers can use code in the final_project.Rmd to reproduce all our findings and charts.
