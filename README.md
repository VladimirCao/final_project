### Biref Overview 

This project evaluates how different degree of covid government responses may affect local happiness levels. We use data from Oxford COVID-19 Government 
Response Tracker (OXCGRT) and World Happiness Report to employ unsupervised predict model and unsupervised cluster analysis, to evaluate the between group differences in clusters and their possible reasons. Readers can use code in the final_project.Rmd to reproduce all our findings and charts.

### Project Key Findings

1. economic support index and containment and health index have larger differences between groups based on happiness index compared with stringency index and government 
response index. 
2. stringency index’s difference between groups is relatively indistinctive. 
3. the government response index’s difference between groups is relatively insignificant.
